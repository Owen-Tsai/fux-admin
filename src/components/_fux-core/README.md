# `fux-core` module 

This folder contains the core low-code features for FusionX.

Please keep all low-code features and sub-modules inside this folder for the possible encapsulate and extraction in the future.

Eventually we will ship an isolated package called `@fusionx/core` which is a refactored version of this folder, with easier management and shipping workflow.
